 - for a user to be authenticated
 - its token should be in local storage

 const token = localStorage.FBIdtoken;

 ** That's why in App.js where the roots are, we check for the token.
        const token  = localStorage.FBIdtoken;

** we decode the toekn to know if it is expired-- if it is then we should redirect to login

let authenticated;
const decodedToken = jwtDecode(token)
if (decodedToken.exp * 1000 < Date.now()){
    window.redirect/href = "/login"
    authenticated = false;
}
else {
    authenticated = true;
}

** REDIRECT outside A COMPONENT
    window.location.href = "/login";

** REDIRECT INSIDE A COMPONENT
    history.push("/login")
